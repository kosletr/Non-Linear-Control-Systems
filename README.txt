# Non-Linear and Robust-Adaptive Control Systems
This repository contains code written by me, Konstantinos Letros, as a project for Control Systems III course during the 7th semester (2018-2019) of my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering (Section: Electronics and Computer Science) at Aristotle Univeristy of Thessaloniki. 

Applications used for this implementation:
1. MathWorks MATLAB
2. MiKTeX
3. Texmaker
