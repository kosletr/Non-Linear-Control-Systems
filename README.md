# Non-Linear-Control-Systems

This repository contains code written by me, Konstantinos Letros, as a project for Dynamical System Modeling course during the 7th semester (academic year: 2018-2019) of my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering (Section: Electronics and Computer Science) at Aristotle Univeristy of Thessaloniki. 

Applications used for this implementation:
 - MathWorks MATLAB
 - MiKTeX
