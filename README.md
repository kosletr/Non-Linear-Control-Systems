# Non-Linear-Control-Systems

## Description

This repository contains code written by me, Konstantinos Letros, as a project for Non Linear Control Systems (Control Systems III) course during the 7th semester (academic year: 2018-2019) of my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering (Section: Electronics and Computer Science) at Aristotle Univeristy of Thessaloniki. 

## Implementations

### Part 1 - Behavioral Analysis of a Non Linear System
This part contains the behavioral analysis of a system including the non linear function M shown bellow. Behavioral Anaylisis is achivied by using different inputs r, initial conditions x(0) and by plotting different enlightening graphs.
